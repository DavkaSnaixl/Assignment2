## Step-by-Step Instructions

This section provides a structured workflow for creating and deploying the resume website. 

### Step 1: Getting started
Make sure to follow instructions carefully for optimal setup.  
1. **Create a new directory for your project:**
- Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project. This directory will contain all the files for your static website. Run:
   ```sh
   mkdir example
   ```
2. **Make a new Pelican project:**
- Move into your project directory and use Pelican quickstart command to set up the basic structure of your website. Run:
   ```
   pelican-quickstart
   ```
3. **Answer the following questions:**
   - **Site title**: `Your answer`
   - **Author name**: `Your answer`
   - **URL prefix**: `https://username.github.io/nameOftheFolder`
   - **Use GitHub Pages?** Yes
   - **Timezone**: `Your answer`

### Step 2: Write your resume in Markdown


Markdown allows simple formatting and it really easy to use

1. **Create a new directory inside your project:**
Inside your project folder, create a subdirectory called content where you will store your files in Markdown format. In your terminal, run:
   ```sh
   cd example
   mkdir content
   ```
2. **Write your resume in Markdown and save it as (.md) file**    
<br>
3. **Include the following content at the top of the file**  
   ```
   Title: Resume for Peter Johnson
   Date: 2025-03-01
   Category: Resume
   ```
4. **Below this metadata, add your resume details formatted using Markdown syntax**
<br>
5. **Move (.md) file inside 'content' folder**
In your terminal run:
   ```sh
   mv resume.md content
   ```
 

### Step 3: Applying the desired Theme

1. **Download and install desired theme:**
To customize the look of your resume website, you can choose from a variety of 
Pelican themes. I personally chose theme `Flex` by Alexandre Vicenzi. To install it, run:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex.git themes/Flex
   ```
2. **Alternative way:**
If you prefer to have options, you can download the complete Pelican themes package by running:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.git themes
   ```

3. **Locate the pelicanconf.py File inside your project folder**  
<br>
4. **Change the parameter 'THEME' inside the File to path of desired theme**
   ```sh
   THEME = "themes/Flex"
   ```

### Step 4: Generating and Testing the Site


1. **Generate the website:**
With your content and configuration in place, you can now generate your website. In the terminal, run:
   ```
   pelican content
   ```
2. **Run a local server to preview:**
To see how your site looks before deploying it online, run a local server:
   ```
   pelican --listen
   ```
3. **Copy the local host URL adress and put it inside your browser**

### Step 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. **Initialize a new Git repository:**

   - On [Github](https://github.com/) press "Create New" -> "New repository"
   - Make Sure to make repositry **Public** if you want others to contribute
  <br>
2. **Clone the repository to your local machine**  
In your terminal, clone the GitHub repository into your project directory:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RepositoryName/example.git
   ```

3. **Generate the website and push to GitHub:**
   ```sh
   pelican content -s publishconf.py
   ghp-import output -b gh-pages
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

4. **Check the live site:**  [https://userNameExample.github.io/NameOfTheFolder](https://userNameExample.github.io/NameOfTheFolder)

## FAQ

**Q1: Why use Markdown instead of raw HTML?**\
A: Markdown is much simplier to read and write rather than HTML, which can make it more accessible for people with very little technical background.

**Q2: I updated my resume, but the changes donâ€™t appear on the live site. Why?**\
A: Make sure that you **regenerate** the site like in [Step 4](#step-4-generating-and-testing-the-site) and **redeploy** to GitHub Pages like in [Step 5](#step-5-deploying-to-github-pages).

**Q3: I can't see my theme on the website that I've made. What should I do?**  
A: If you are viewing the site on localhost, check the pelicanconf.py file and ensure that you have set the **THEME** variable correctly (for example, `THEME = "themes/Flex"`). 
If you are hosting your site on GitHub Pages, verify that the **SITEURL** in publishconf.py variable is set properly to your GitHub Pages URL (for example, `SITEURL = "https://username.github.io/FolderName"`). If these configurations are not 
correctly set, Pelican will display default theme rather than displaying your chosen theme.
